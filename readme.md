# Odin-Recipes

This project is a basic recipe website built using HTML. It serves as a practice exercise to demonstrate HTML skills and understanding.

## Why Odin-Recipes?
Odin-Recipes serves as a practical exercise to put into practice all the HTML knowledge I have acquired. Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in creating web pages, organizing content, and linking multiple pages together. The website may not have fancy visuals at this stage, but it lays the foundation for future styling with CSS.

## Key Features
- Index page with links to multiple recipe pages
- Recipe pages containing dish images, descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions
